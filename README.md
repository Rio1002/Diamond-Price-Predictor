##üíé Diamond Price Predictor
This project develops a machine learning model to predict diamond prices based on key characteristics like carat, cut, color, and clarity. It aims to provide transparent and data-driven price estimations for buyers, sellers, and jewelers.

##‚ú® Project Overview
Accurate diamond pricing is crucial. This tool addresses that by predicting prices using diamond attributes.

##üöÄ Features
Intelligent Price Prediction: Uses ML models for accurate diamond price estimation.

Key Attribute Consideration: Accounts for the "4 Cs" (Carat, Cut, Color, Clarity) plus dimensions, depth, and table.

User Interface (Conceptual): Designed to integrate with a simple web interface for easy use.

Reliable Evaluation: Assessed using standard metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R-squared.

## üìä Dataset Description

The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of diamond attributes and their corresponding prices. Each entry in the dataset includes the following key features:

| Attribute   | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **carat**   | Weight of the diamond, measured in carats. This is a primary determinant of a diamond's value. |
| **cut**     | The quality of the diamond's cut, influencing its brilliance and fire. Categories range from *Fair* to *Ideal*, with *Ideal* representing the highest quality. |
| **color**   | The diamond's color grade, assessed on a scale from **J** (light yellow or brown tint) to **D** (colorless and rarest). |
| **clarity** | The clarity rating, which measures the absence of inclusions (internal flaws) and blemishes (external imperfections). Grades range from **I1** (Included) to **IF** (Internally Flawless). |
| **x, y, z** | The physical dimensions of the diamond in millimeters, representing its length (**x**), width (**y**), and depth (**z**). |
| **depth**   | The total depth percentage of the diamond, calculated as the ratio of the depth (**z**) to the average of length and width: **z / mean(x, y)**. This affects how light reflects within the stone. |
| **table**   | The width of the top flat facet (table) of the diamond relative to its widest point, expressed as a percentage. |
| **price**   | üéØ **Target Variable**: The price of the diamond in US dollars. This is the value the machine learning model aims to predict. |

##üß† Model Development
The process involves:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.

Model Selection: Exploring models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Model Training: Training the selected model on split data.

Model Evaluation: Assessing performance using MAE, RMSE, and R-squared.
